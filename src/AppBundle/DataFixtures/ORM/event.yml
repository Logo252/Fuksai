          type: Observational:moon
          description: It’s very cool to see the last quarter moon just after it rises, around midnight. Just after the last quarter moon rises, its lighted portion is always facing downwards, more or less toward the horizon. Why? Because you’re on the midnight portion of Earth – with the sun below your feet – just as it’s below this moon.
